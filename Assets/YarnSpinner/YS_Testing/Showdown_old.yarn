Ailyn: Hey, did you find out anything else?
You: Yeah, but I don't have a lot of time to explain. I need you to open the door.
Ailyn Door to what?
You: The bridge. I'm going in.
Ailyn The bridge? Absolutely not.
You: No? Why?
Ailyn What do you mean why? My ass is on the line if I open it without authority approval. I'm already thin on ice when I let you out during lockout earlier.
You: But it's important! Lives are on the line! I have to save everyone!
Ailyn Save them from what? You haven't told me anything since you got here.

You: I told you what Tav said to me earlier, remember?
Ailyn I do. We confirmed it as true.
You: Not everyone on the crew could make those heading changes. It has to be a higher up, like the Captain.
Ailyn That's just speculation.
You: I know she's a gossip, but I she has the information I need, so I went back to talk with her.
You: She was the first to see the EPMs. The recipent of them is someone with the Captain's last name. Plus, the subjects imply that he was sending confidential information.
You: He should know better than that.
Ailyn You really trust Tav?
You: She doesn't gossip freely or lie. She wants info in exchange, so I believe her.

You: The captain is betraying us. The change in course we discovered earlier? It's to another planet owned by another firm.
You: And that planet is unhabitable, but they somehow convinced the captain that it's safe.
Ailyn You're just guessing.
You: Forrester told me all this.
Ailyn Wait, did she work for the other firm?
You: Yes.
You: It took some convincing, but I got other info out of her.
You: Essentially, the firm needs to make money, even if the planet is dangerous.
You: So if we go there, then the other firm loses a lot of money.
You: The captain is being played all for monetary gain.
Ailyn They care more about money then people.

You: Ailyn, I don't want to put you in more danger. If I tell you, I don't know what will happen to you.
Ailyn If I open the bridge for no reason, I'm ruined. I don't open it unless there's a good reason.
Ailyn You involved me so much earlier, and now you won't tell me shit? Just go away.
You: Please...
Ailyn I said no.

Ailyn You better do this right. My ass is on the line.

You: Ailyn, thank you so much. I couldn't have done this without you.
