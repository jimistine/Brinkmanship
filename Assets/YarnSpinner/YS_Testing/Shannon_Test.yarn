// YOU: Or more like, I noticed something strange.
// DAD: Don't you notice weird stuff all the time? I mean, it's space.
// MOM: Hey! Don't interrupt them!
// MOM: Please dear, continue.
// YOU: Thanks.
// YOU: The course of the ship, it's different. We're going way off the original path.
//     <<wait 1>>
// MOM: Are you sure? Maybe you noticed something that you didn't know was always there?
// YOU: I've been at the terminal for years. I know the course like the back of my hand. I even checked to see if I was seeing something was, but I wasn't. I'm certain of what I saw.
// YOU: We're changing course, I'm almost certain.
//     <<wait 3>>
// YOU: Mom, Dad, say something, please.

// YOU: A gun? Dad, where did you?
// DAD: I've always had it. 
// MOM: He brought it onto the ship when we departed. It's older than you, sweetie. I can't believe you managed to sneak that on, dear.
// DAD: You know that I tend to be a bit paranoid. I always said that there was a chance of something going wrong, and now it's happened.
// YOU: You've had it this whole time?
// DAD: Yep. Also, there's only six bullets in there, so use it wisely.
// YOU: Wait, you're telling me to use this?
// DAD: Of course. Like I said, you found something big, best to protect yourself.
// MOM: Are you sure about this?
// DAD: I am. It's about time that gun was used anyway.
//     <<wait  2>>
// YOU: Thanks, Dad.
// DAD: You're welcome.
// MOM: Be careful out there!

// YOU: I don't know where you got this, but thanks, Dad.
// DAD: I brought that with me when we first got onto this ship. Maybe I'm paranoid, but I thought there was a possibility of something going wrong and if that did happen, I better have something to protect myself.
// YOU: You didn't think to tell me until now?
// MOM: Honestly, I forgot he had it. I told him it was stupid to bring it on board.
// DAD: I had great hindsight. And now, our boy needs it, just in case.
// MOM: I don't think this is a good idea. I want you to protect yourself, but...
// DAD: It will be fine. There's only six bullets in there anyway. Don't rely on it too much.
// YOU: Six? Only six?
// DAD: I had to sneak that gun on board. It was hard to hide bullets anywhere besides the gun. Be careful with your shot.
// YOU: Okay, I'll use it the best I can.
// MOM: Be safe, dear!
// -> Shoot door
//     <<jump shoot>>
// -> Leave

// DAD: What the hell, son?
// YOU: Sorry, sorry. I wanted to see if it worked.
// DAD: There are others places to test your aim besides our door.
// YOU: Sorry...
// YOU: I'll just go now.
