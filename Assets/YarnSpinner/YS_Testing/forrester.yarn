YOU: Chief Kee?
YOU: Chief Kee, are you there?
FORRESTER: What in the world…
FORRESTER: Hey, trying to get some shut-eye here. Not like we get any when the ship’s running proper.
FORRESTER: Don’t tell me… it’s the gnat, isn’t it? Get it? Guh-nat?
//The “g” in “gnat” is usually silent but Forrester really wants to make this joke, so she pronounces “nat” oddly then clarifies it in her next sentence.
->YOU: Gnat? That’s a new one.
	FORRESTER: I’ll give you three guesses what it means.
	FORRESTER: Nah, screw that. You’ll stand there for hours goddamn ruminating the possibilities.
	FORRESTER: It stands for “Goddamn NAT.” How about that?
->YOU: No, it’s Kase.
	FORRESTER: How they let you graduate from Shana’s kindergarten, I’ll never know.
->YOU: Never mind.

FORRESTER: Something’s always happening with the ship.
FORRESTER: How many years we’ve been on this voyage, decades even, and you still get spooked by creaks in the floorboards.
YOU: Floorboards?
FORRESTER: Eh, that’s before your time.
YOU: But anyway, I’m serious. I was looking into the ship’s course just now, when I –
FORRESTER: And why were you looking into the ship’s course?
YOU: I thought something was off.
FORRESTER: Maybe something’s off with you.
FORRESTER: You’re the one staying after hours every night, mapping out the stars or whatever your fancy might be, like we would ever go anywhere other than one planet in our lifetimes.
FORRESTER: Then you show up at my desk five minutes before the end of the day, asking me to vet an “anomaly” that turns out to be just your misinterpretation.
FORRESTER: How do you know you haven’t started seeing things?
->YOU: If what I saw is true, everyone could be in danger.

FORRESTER: Look who’s a drama king.
FORRESTER: The ship’s engineering is foolproof. Are you doubting the vessel that’s kept us all breathing for as long as you’ve been alive?
FORRESTER: In fact, more importantly than that–
FORRESTER: Are you insulting everything I’ve done to keep it together?
-> YOU: If that’s what it takes.
	YOU: I know you don’t respect me, and maybe I haven’t earned your respect.

FORRESTER: Good.
FORRESTER: Seems I underestimated you, Kase.
FORRESTER: Not that I regret it. Underestimating children is part of our safety protocol.
FORRESTER: Thought you were too much of a suck-up, trying to be real good at your job and real good at following orders like all the other kids.
FORRESTER: But you got your own brain. A brain that really likes maps for no other reason than liking maps.
YOU: What do you mean?

FORRESTER: What did you learn about him growing up?
FORRESTER: In your kindergarten and vocational programs.
YOU: He was always a leader, I guess.
YOU: He was important on the moon our families came from, so that’s why he became captain.
FORRESTER: Sounds about right.
FORRESTER: The storied hero of our mother-moon.
FORRESTER: And now? With these new… revelations of yours?

FORRESTER: That rubs you the wrong way because…?

FORRESTER: Consider me cowed, gnat. You were right.
FORRESTER: There was a course correction… and whoever did it tried to cover it up.
YOU: No way.
FORRESTER: I’m not gonna speculate on who did it. I don’t want my head on a platter.
FORRESTER: But whoever it was, they had some kind of clearance.
YOU: So what was the course correction?
FORRESTER: Looks like the ship’s now headed to the Modula Region.
FORRESTER: Exactly where to, I can’t be sure.
FORRESTER: You know who Urnst is, right? The agriculture head?
YOU: Yeah, why?
FORRESTER: They know about plants everywhere. In every single system, even.
FORRESTER: Real infodump of a person, they are.
FORRESTER: But if anyone would know about the habitable planets in Modula, it’s Urnst.
