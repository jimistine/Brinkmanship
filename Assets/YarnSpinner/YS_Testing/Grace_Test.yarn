Forrester: Listen, kid. #line:08df81d 
Forrester: If what Urnst says is true… #line:0152093 
Forrester: Then the <style=imp><shake>captain's single-handedly steering all 30,000 of us to our deaths</shake></style>, #line:02c87e3 
Forrester: while believing the exact opposite. #line:0853957 
Forrester: Do you really think you can talk him down? #line:0efffe6 
-> Yes. #line:0fc9538 
    //<<wait 0.5>>
    YOU: I do.	 #line:0cd5ced 
    Forrester: That's some confidence. #line:07ef819 
	Forrester: Makes me miss being young. #line:0739c40 
-> Urnst wouldn't come with me… #line:00ec388 
    //<<wait 0.5>>
    YOU: Well, Urnst wouldn't come with me... #line:09653aa 
	Forrester: Hah, that's Urnst for ya. #line:0bb5422 
	Forrester: Trust me, it's better this way. Urnst couldn't talk a tree into dropping its leaves for winter. #line:0cb8eb0 
    //<<wait 0.5>>
Forrester: You still got that gun, right? #line:0d7b1b5 
Forrester: I gotta ask, kid. #line:0776407 
Forrester: If it comes down to it… #line:09ab7cd 
Forrester: Are you gonna pull the trigger? #line:0bb0f03 
-> Of course. #line:0f51f6f 
    //<<wait 2>>
    YOU: Of course. #line:090f4ad 
    Forrester: Okay. #line:097d1f1 
    Forrester: Not gonna lie, I don't know if that's more or less reassuring. #line:0f4afba 
    Forrester: Just do me a favor… try not to shoot the pipes. #line:036a7f7 
    Forrester: Persuading the captain's one thing, decompressing the ship's another.  #line:0202a9e 
    //<<set_pipes_learned>> //If the player knows about the pipes, the pipes flash red in the cockpit and you can shoot them if you want?? IDK haha
-> I don't know if I can. #line:0d24841 
    //<<wait 0.5>>
    YOU: I don't know if I can. #line:03977d2 
    Forrester: Can't say I blame you. #line:0f1e232 
    Forrester: You know, I just thought of something. #line:0f2d665 
    Forrester: There should be an intercom in the cockpit. You could slam the button, tell the whole ship everything you know. #line:0dd90b4 
    Forrester: That could change his mind just as well as a bullet to the knee.  #line:09c7e13 
    //<<set_intercom_learned>> //If the player knows about the pipes, the intercom flashes red in the cockpit and you can shoot it to activate it, and shoot it again to destroy it.
//<<wait 0.5>>
Forrester: You sure you're ready to go in there? If you do, <style=imp>there's no going back.</style> #line:0662168 
    -> No time to lose. #line:09478f7 
        <<jump going_in>>
